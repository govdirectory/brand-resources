# Contributing to Govdirectory

🙇‍♀️ Thank you for contributing!

We love issues and pull requests from everyone.
If you're not comfortable with those features of GitHub, you can also just [start a discussion](https://github.com/govdirectory/brand-resources/discussions).

## Direction

When contributing, it might be helpful to know what we want Govdirectory to be.
We have defined our **vision** as:

>Our vision is a world where people are empowered to engage with their government to ensure responsive, inclusive, participatory and representative decision-making at all levels.

and we also have set a **mission** to:

>We will enable a community powered directory where the online presence of every public organization is easily findable, queryable and trustworthy.

We hope that will help you contribute meaningfully.

## Problems, suggestions and questions in issues

Please help development by reporting problems, suggesting changes and asking questions.
To do this, you can [create a GitHub issue](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/) for this project in the [GitHub Issues for the website](https://github.com/govdirectory/brand-resources/issues/new).

In particular, we use the tags [good first issue](https://github.com/govdirectory/brand-resources/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) so that you can see where you can start and [help wanted](https://github.com/govdirectory/brand-resources/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) where we still need input.

You don't need to change any of our resources or documentation to be a contributor!

## Weekly collab hour

Every Friday at 15.00 CEST we have an open session in [Jitsi](https://meet.jit.si/GovdirectoryCollabHour) where we hack and work on the data together.
Everyone is welcome and it's open for questions.

## Documentation and media in pull requests

If you want to add to the documentation or media, you should make a pull request.

If you never used GitHub, get up to speed with one of the great free interactive courses in the [GitHub learning lab](https://lab.github.com/) on working with GitHub and working with MarkDown, the syntax this project's documentation is in.

This project is [licensed CC-0](LICENSE.md), which essentially means that the project, along with your contributions is in the public domain in whatever jurisdiction possible, and everyone can do whatever they want with it.

### 1. Make your changes

In this project we use branches for changes and don't usually commit direct to the main branch.
When you've forked this repository, please make sure to create a feature branch.

Add your changes in commits [with a message that explains them](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/5-useful-tips-for-a-better-commit-message).
Document choices or decisions you make in the commit message, this will enable everyone to be informed of your choices in the future.

If you are adding media, make sure you've added and updated the relevant documentation before you submit your pull request.

#### Standards to follow

These are the standards that Govdirectory uses.
Please make sure that your contributions are aligned with them so that they can be merged more easily.

* [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/)
* [Standard Readme](https://github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme/blob/main/spec.md) (applicable for the README file only)
* [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) extended format for dates (e.g. 2023-09-17)

For icons, we are using the libraries [Maki](https://labs.mapbox.com/maki-icons/) and [Temaki](https://ideditor.github.io/temaki/docs/) for a consistent style.
If you can't find a usable icon in those sets, try to emulate their style or find other icons similar to it.

For static bitmap images used on the web, we prefer using the `.webp` file format to optimize and compress images efficiently.
Please consider converting new images to the `.webp` format using tools like TinyPNG or similar.
This helps ensure that static images are optimized for website usage from the start, contributing to a faster and more efficient browsing experience.

For vector images, we prefer the `.svg` file format.
If you use Inkscape, please save as plain svg rather than the Inkscape version if possible.
Please also consider optimizing the file with [SVGOMG](https://svgomg.net/). 

While we haven't committed to be fully compliant with the [Standard for Public Code](https://standard.publiccode.net) we would appreciate if contributions brings Govdirectory closer to meeting it rather than make it deviate further.

### 2. Pull request

When submitting the pull request, please accompany it with a description of the problem you are trying to solve and the issue numbers that this pull request fixes.

### 3. Improve

#### Reviews

All contributions have to be reviewed by someone.
Currently, all reviewing maintainers are volunteers, and will review as fast as we can, but it might take up to a week before you get a reply.

It could be that your contribution can be merged immediately by a maintainer.
However, usually, a new pull request needs some improvements before it can be merged.
Other contributors (or helper robots) might have feedback.
If this is the case the reviewing maintainer will help you improve your documentation and media.

If your documentation and media have passed human review, it is merged.

For reviewers: check that contributions conforms to the standards, over all vision and other documented decisions, as well as that they are in scope of the project.

## Feedback
